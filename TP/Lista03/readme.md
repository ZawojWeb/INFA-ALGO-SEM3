Technologie Programowania List 3 - this list is about design patterns wchih resolve problems:

    - Adapter : How to use 'old' or 'extraneous' classes and methods for new needs without changing the code
    - Builder : How to distribute responsibility in order to efficiently create various complex objects in a single process
    - Composite : If we want clients to be able to ignore differences between objects and their assemblies
    - Decorator : Changes methods dynamically, without creating a hierarchy of classes and obscuring
    - Facade : Coupling between system components
    - Factory Method : who is responsible for creating objects
    - Abstract Factory : The difference between Factory Method and Abstract Factory is that in Factory Method we have one type of products, in Abstract Factory a family of related products (many interfaces)
    - Flyweight : How to effectively manage a large number of objects
    - Proxy : How to avoid direct access to an object
    - Singleton : It guarantees that the class has only one instance and provides global access to it.
    - State : An object can be in different states. The preservation of an object depends on its condition.
